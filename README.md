# Programming Paradigms Exploration
## CS 314 - Principles of Programming Languages

This collection showcases an exploration of various programming paradigms, including functional, declarative, and imperative, completed as a series of mini-projects. Languages featured include OCaml, Prolog, and Python.

## Assignment 1 - Functional Paradigm with OCaml, Part 1
A series of basic functions, realized in the functional paradigm with OCaml.

## Assignment 2 - Functional Paradigm with OCaml, Part 2
More complex functions, realized in the functional paradigm with OCaml.

## Assignment 3 - Functional Paradigm with OCaml, Part 3
Data structure manipulation, realized in the functional paradigm with OCaml.

## Assignment 4 - Declarative Paradigm with Prolog
A series of basic functions, realized in the declarative paradigm with Prolog.

## Assignment 5 - Imperative Paradigm with Python
A series of complex functions, realized in the imperative paradigm with Python.

## Final - Non-deterministic Abstract Interpreter with Python
A basic interpreter for a Prolog-like language, built with Python.
